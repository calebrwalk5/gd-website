            <br><entry style="font-size:1vw;">STOCK MARKET CRASH
<br>I don't know what to do. I don't know what we are going to do. We've lost so much. The stock market crashed today and .... and we lost every penny we invested. Every last cent is gone. How did this happen? How did we loose so much?

            <br><entry style="font-size:1vw;"><strong>FARMERS</strong>
<br>I was talking to a friends today. She just recently was able to speak with her aunt who lives out in the west. Her aunts family are farmers and she told me all about the hardships they are facing right now. Actually, I should say the hardships they've been facing. What the world has been dealing with since the stock market crash, the farmers have been dealing with since the end of World War I. The prosperity of the twenties never reached the farmers because at the end of the war farmers continued to produce crops at the same rate as during the war. This caused overproduction. Because of the surplus, farmers were forced to cut their prices which means less income also. The farmers economy plummeted while everyone else prospered. Once the great depression occurred, farmers were thrust further into poverty. They sunk even deeper after the dust bowl. I feel so bad for them. I mean, we're all going through tough times, but farmers have it bad. Because of there immense poverty, foreclosures and evictions are often. Many who lost their homes came together to build little shanty towns. Her aunts family were one of the people to be kicked out of their home. They live in one of those shanty towns now. They call them Hoover towns. I wish there was a way for us to help them, but we can barely help ourselves.

This surely was an eventful day. The announcement was made over the radio by Henry Field that a bill has been passed in Congress whereby the banks and farmers are to have a large appropriation of money. The money for the farmers is to be loaned to them at 51/2% up to the amount of $400 for feed and seed only. What a help this will be for some, especially for those who suffered a crop failure the past year. We have enough feed and can manage to buy what seed we lack.

<br>Already the stock market has begun to climb, as well as the price of all commodities in the line of farm products. Well people are excited, waiting breathlessly to know if it is really true. Several cars of grain have been shipped from Shenandoah to South Dakota, which is in the drouth stricken area where the stock are dying in the fields from starvation. Last year it went to Arkansas. The money being donated by the friends of K.F.N.F. who in turn buy corn from the farmers. The freight is donated by the railroad.

<br>The War is still going on with intense fighting on the part of both countries. U.S. still stands by with only enough soldiers there to protect our property. Russia surprised everyone by saying she was willing to disarm completely forever--this from a country who is teaching her children "There is no God". Surely it must be the cost of war they are considering since they are so engrossed in their 5-year government money-making scheme--well anyway it behooves such countries as ours to do as much.

<br>Yesterday was the World Day of Prayer. I am sure if every individual over the world, including those engaged in killing each other, would have stopped for a few minutes in prayerful thought concerning his fellow man and God, the Millenym would be here.
